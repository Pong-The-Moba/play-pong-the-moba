pong-the-moba playtest instructions
==================
Welcome to the pong-the-moba Alpha Playtest! Thanks for helping us out.

Start by either downloading the zip file or cloning the repository. Cloning will speed up the download if you participate in any later playtests, but the choice is yours.

While the download goes, find out the local ip address of the player who will run the server for your game. Currently, the game is played peer-to-peer, which means until some witchcraft happens, it can only be played by LAN. :-(.

Once that completes, open the directory produced and run server.jar. Then, both players should run Client.jar. If you see a black popup window asking for an IP address, you're doing it right.

If you don't see this screen, check to make sure your Java version is current, that you haven't removed the jar from the directory, and that you have execute permissions on the jar. If all of these are the case, send us an email saying what you saw.

Now, both players should enter the IP address of the server. The player running the server can also enter localhost or 127.0.0.1. Then, hit enter or click go. If your internet is bad, you'll see a crash here. Most likely, you're entering the wrong ip address – possibly a public-facing address. Double check that, then send us an email saying what you saw.

Hopefully, you're now in the game. The controls are:
up/down: up, down. Amazing.
Left/right: rotate paddle counter/clockwise.
Space: Shoot laser
Q: Explosive paddle.

The teal bars behind the paddles are mana. The big numbers in the middle are the score. The red and blue line wandering around the middle of the game is the ball serve machine – when you score, the ball will pop out of it.

Thank you for your time and effort! Please fill out the survey here:
